Other members of the sextet were Robert Buck (guitar), Steven Gustafson (bass), Dennis Drew (keyboards), and Jerry Augustyniak (drums). The group gigged extensively and recorded independently before signing with Elektra and making The Wishing Chair in 1985. Co-founder Lombardo left the band in 1986, and they continued as a quintet, releasing their second album, In My Tribe, in 1987. This album broke into the charts, where it stayed 77 weeks, peaking at number 37. Blind Man's Zoo, the 1989 follow-up, hit number 13 and went gold.\r\nAfter 1992's Our Time in Eden had finished its run on the charts, Merchant announced that she was leaving for a solo career. MTV Unplugged was released a few months after her departure. The remaining 10,000 Maniacs decided to continue performing, adding the folk-rock duo John & Mary (original member Lombardo and violinist/vocalist Mary Ramsey). The new lineup released Love Among the Ruins. Merchant released her first solo album, Tigerlily, in the summer of 1995 and a follow-up, Ophelia, in 1998. In 1999, the remaining Maniacs released The Earth Pressed Flat on Bar/None. Sadly, a year later lead guitarist and founding member Robert Buck, who co-wrote some of the band's classics like \"Hey Jack Kerouac,\" \"What's the Matter Here?,\" and \"These Are Days,\" died of liver failure on December 19, 2000. He was 42.\r\nFollowing Buck's death, 10,0000 Maniacs took a year-long hiatus, reconvening in December 2001 to play a benefit concert with Jeff Erickson (now playing guitar). After this concert, Gustafson, Drew, and Augustyniak assembled a new lineup of 10,000 Maniacs featuring guitarist Erickson and vocalist Oskar Saville, who previously sang with Rubygrass. Over the next four years, this version of the Maniacs toured regularly -- their profile was raised somewhat in 2004 when Rhino released the career retrospective Campfire Songs: The Popular, Obscure & Unknown Recordings -- and in 2006, Mary Ramsey began playing the occasional concert with the band. Saville left the band in 2007 and Ramsey returned to her role as frontwoman.\r\n10,000 Maniacs remained a staple on the folk-rock circuit right into the new decade, and in 2011 they released their first new recording in a decade: an EP called Triangles, which appeared on their label, Ruby Wristwatch. That year, the group also played two 30th anniversary concerts in their hometown of Jamestown, New York, then set out to record a new album in 2012. The resulting Music from the Motion Picture -- the first new 10,000 Maniacs album in 14 years -- appeared in February 2013. Not long after its release, Bob Wachter (who had played drums with the group back in 1981 before Augustyniak joined on full-time basis) died at the age of 49. John Lombardo re-joined the band in 2014 as they were recording the album that became Twice Told Tales, a 2015 collection of British folk covers. The following year saw the band celebrating their 35th anniversary with the release of Playing Favorites, a collection of their best-known songs recorded live in Jamestown, New York. ~ William Ruhlmann","index":1,"viewCount":536,"skipCount":18,"lastViewedAt":1640824167,"thumb":"/library/metadata/45209/thumb/1641184622","art":"/library/metadata/45209/art/1641184622","addedAt":1619389679,"updatedAt":1641184622,"Genre":[{"tag":"Pop/Rock"}],"Country":[{"tag":"United States of America"}]},{"ratingKey":"45135","key":"/library/metadata/45135/children","guid":"plex://artist/5d07bbfc403c6402904a5f12","type":"artist","title":"4 Non Blondes","summary":"4 Non Blondes howled their way onto the charts in 1993 with \"What's Up?\" and then vanished without a whisper. Formed in 1989 with Linda Perry (vocals), Shaunna Hall (guitar), Christa Hillhouse (bass), and  Wanda Day (drums), 4 Non Blondes had no problems attracting major labels based on live shows and local radio support from KUSF, but the labels didn't know how to market them. After Day was replaced by Dawn Richardson, the group was eventually signed to Interscope Records and released Bigger, Better, Faster, More? in 1992. Although Hall contributed guitar tracks and some songs, she left before the album was released (replaced by Roger Rocha for the tour). Dominated by Perry's high-pitched singing, \"What's Up?\" was slowly added to modern rock stations and then crossed over into the mainstream, peaking at number 11 on the Billboard Top 200. The video for \"What's Up?\" became a smash on MTV, propelling sales of the album to over six million copies worldwide. \"What's Up?\" was selected as Best Song by the Bay Area Music Awards; moreover, Perry was chosen as Best Female Vocalist and Bigger, Better, Faster, More? won for Best Album. The group toured with Neil Young, Pearl Jam, and Bob Dylan. The band recorded tunes for the soundtracks to Wayne's World 2 and Airheads. However, Perry felt that the group had become too pop; consequently, she left 4 Non Blondes. She released her solo debut, In Flight, in 1995. Perry departed from Interscope Records in 1998 and recorded her second full-length, After Hours, for her own label, Rockstar Records. ~ Michael Sutton","index":1,"viewCount":13,"lastViewedAt":1634101648,"thumb":"/library/metadata/45135/thumb/1641184576","art":"/library/metadata/45135/art/1641184576","addedAt":1619389674,"updatedAt":1641184576,"Genre":[{"tag":"Pop/Rock"}],"Country":[{"tag":"United States of America"}]},{"ratingKey":"46555","key":"/library/metadata/46555/children","guid":"local://46555","type":"artist","title":"Aaron Copeland; London Symphony Orchestra","summary":"","index":1,"addedAt":1619532819},{"ratingKey":"3570","key":"/library/metadata/3570/children","guid":"plex://artist/5d07bbfd403c6402904a6593","type":"artist","title":"ABBA","summary":"The most commercially successful pop group of the 1970s, ABBA put Sweden on the map as a music mecca and influenced the sound of pop for decades to come. With their flamboyant fashion sense and two-couple membership, the quartet also became pop culture icons. However, it was their distinctive harmonies and intricate production (combining folk, pop, rock, and even classical) introduced on songs from their 1973 debut album, Ring Ring, that won them countless fans. It's a sound that garnered the first Swedish win at Eurovision in 1974 with \"Waterloo,\" the title track from their second album and a song that topped the charts across Europe while reaching the U.S. Top Ten. ABBA went to number one in the States with 1976's \"Dancing Queen,\" another worldwide smash. The hits kept coming through the early '80s, including 1978's \"Take a Chance on Me\" and the dramatic 1980 ballad \"The Winner Takes It All.\" Though ABBA disbanded in 1982, they remained in the pop culture consciousness for decades to follow thanks to popular compilations, licensing, and the success of Mamma Mia!, the Tony-nominated 1999 jukebox musical that was adapted for the big screen in 2008. As both a stage and film production, Mamma Mia! was a massive hit -- the movie spawned a sequel, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again -- attracting new audiences who were born long after the group's split. ABBA unexpectedly returned to activity in the late 2000s, a comeback that culminated with the 2021 release of Voyage, their first album in 40 years.\r\nThe origins of ABBA date back to 1966, when keyboardist and vocalist Benny Andersson, a onetime member of the popular beat outfit the Hep Stars, first teamed with guitarist and vocalist Bjorn Ulvaeus, the leader of the folk-rock unit the Hootenanny Singers. The two performers began composing songs together and handling session and production work for Polar Music/Union Songs, a publishing company owned by Stig Anderson, himself a prolific songwriter throughout the '50s and '60s. At the same time, both Andersson and Ulvaeus worked on projects with their respective girlfriends: Ulvaeus had become involved with vocalist Agnetha Faltskog, a performer with a recent number one Swedish hit, \"I Was So in Love,\" under her belt, while Andersson began seeing Anni-Frid Lyngstad, a one-time jazz singer who rose to fame by winning a national talent contest.\r\nIn 1971, Faltskog ventured into theatrical work, accepting the role of Mary Magdalene in a Swedish production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Jesus Christ Superstar; her cover of the musical's \"Don't Know How to Love Him\" became a significant hit. The following year, the duo of Andersson and Ulvaeus scored a massive international hit with \"People Need Love,\" which featured Faltskog and Lyngstad on backing vocals. The record's success earned them an invitation to enter the Swedish leg of the 1973 Eurovision song contest, where, under the unwieldy name of Bjorn, Benny, Agnetha & Frida, they submitted \"Ring Ring,\" which proved extremely popular with audiences but placed only third in the judges' ballots.\r\nThe next year, rechristened ABBA (a suggestion from Stig Anderson and an acronym of the members' first names), the quartet submitted the single \"Waterloo,\" and became the first Swedish act to win the Eurovision competition. The record proved to be the first of many international hits, although the group hit a slump after their initial success as subsequent singles failed to chart. In 1975, however, ABBA issued \"S.O.S.,\" a smash not only in America and Britain but also in non-English speaking countries such as Spain, Germany and the Benelux nations, where the group's success was fairly unprecedented. A string of hits followed, including \"Mamma Mia,\" \"Fernando,\" and \"Dancing Queen\" (ABBA's sole U.S. chart-topper), further honing their lush, buoyant sound; by the spring of 1976, they were already in position to issue their first Greatest Hits collection.\r\nABBA's popularity continued in 1977, when both \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" and \"The Name of the Game\" dominated airwaves. The group also starred in the feature film ABBA: The Movie, which was released in 1978. That year Andersson and Lyngstad married, as had Ulvaeus and Faltskog in 1971, although the latter couple separated a few months later; in fact, romantic suffering was the subject of many songs on the quartet's next LP, 1979's Voulez-Vous. Shortly after the release of 1980s Super Trouper, Andersson and Lyngstad divorced as well, further straining the group dynamic. The Visitors, issued the following year, was the final LP of new ABBA material of that era, and the foursome officially disbanded after the December 1982 release of their single \"Under Attack.\"\r\nAlthough all of the group's members soon embarked on new projects -- both Lyngstad and Faltskog issued solo LPs, while Andersson and Ulvaeus collaborated with Tim Rice on the musical Chess -- none proved as successful as the group's earlier work, largely because throughout much of the world, especially Europe and Australia, the ABBA phenomenon never went away. Repackaged hits compilations and live collections continued hitting the charts long after the group's demise, and new artists regularly pointed to the quartet's inspiration: while the British dance duo Erasure released a covers collection, ABBA-esque, an Australian group called Bjorn Again found success as ABBA impersonators. In 1993, \"Dancing Queen\" became a staple of U2's \"Zoo TV\" tour -- Andersson and Ulvaeus even joined the Irish superstars on-stage in Stockholm -- while the 1995 feature Muriel's Wedding, which won acclaim for its depiction of a lonely Australian girl who seeks refuge in ABBA's music, helped bring the group's work to the attention of a new generation of moviegoers and music fans.\r\nIn 1997, theater producer Judy Craymer commissioned playwright/screenwriter Catherine Johnson to write a musical-theater showcase for ABBA's songs. Members of the band were involved in the development of Mamma Mia!, which opened on the West End in April 1999. A year later, it was nominated for an Olivier Award for Best New Musical. The Broadway premiere followed in October 2001, leading to five Tony nominations, including best musical, best book for Johnson, and best orchestrations for Andersson, Ulvaeus, and Martin Koch. A film version starring, among others, Amanda Seyfried and Meryl Streep hit movie theaters in mid-2008, and its accompanying soundtrack reached number one in over a dozen countries, including the U.S., Canada, and Australia. In 2010, ABBA were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Barry and Robin Gibb.\r\nAfter a nearly 14-year run, the original Broadway production of Mamma Mia! closed in September 2015. The following January, all four members of ABBA attended Mamma Mia! The Party in Stockholm. That June marked the 50th anniversary of Andersson and Ulvaeus' first meeting. Returning with most of the same cast from the 2008 film, a sequel, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, saw a worldwide release in 2018. Its soundtrack went to number three on the Billboard 200, topping the album charts in places as far-spread as the U.K., Australia, and Greece. Around that time, a reunited ABBA returned to the studio to begin work on their first material in over 30 years. In late August 2021, the band launched a website and social media accounts for Voyage, a new studio album and \"avatar concert\" residency in London involving motion-capture digital avatars of the quartet alongside a ten-piece band. The lead singles \"I Still Have Faith in You\" and \"Don't Shut Me Down\" were released simultaneously in September; the latter song took the band to the top of Sweden's singles chart for the first time since 1978. Stateside, \"Don't Shut Me Down\" landed on Billboard's Digital Song Sales chart (number 32) alongside renewed interest in \"Dancing Queen\" (number 19), while \"I Still Have Faith in You\" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Record of the Year. The Voyage LP followed on Capitol in November 2021. ~ Jason Ankeny & Marcy Donelson","index":1,"viewCount":32,"skipCount":7,"lastViewedAt":1635564083,"thumb":"/library/metadata/3570/thumb/1641702450","art":"/library/metadata/3570/art/1641702450","addedAt":1592507211,"updatedAt":1641702450,"Genre":[{"tag":"Pop/Rock"}],"Country":[{"tag":"Sweden"}]}]}}"""

It's a soundtrack and plays like a soundtrack, with many cuts from current stars and new artists (several associated with Eminem's fledgling Shady imprint), plus a couple of previously released tracks, most of it very high quality, whether it's a hard-hitting Jay-Z, a sultry Macy Gray, or Taryn Manning's Boomkat's sexy slow burn \"Wasting My Time.\" Sure, there's a couple of tracks that fall flat -- Young Zee and Obie Trice feel strained -- but it all flows well, and it's all strong. But it's also all overshadowed by four blindingly great new songs from Eminem (four and a half, if you count his show-stealing appearance on D-12's \"Rap Game\"), all illustrating a step forward from The Eminem Show, even if they work a familiar pseudo-biographical ground. What impresses is not just the wordplay and delivery, but the music itself -- fuller, richer than anything on his previous records, appropriately cinematic in scope and pushing Eminem toward new heights. The opening track and first single \"Lose Yourself\" is easily equaled by the title song with its layered pianos, while \"Rabbit Run\" is nearly as good. Hearing these, it's hard not to greedily hunger for a full album of this, but the soundtrack is excellent as is and these new Eminem cuts make it a necessary purchase. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine","index":1,"rating":8,"skipCount":2,"year":2002,"thumb":"/library/metadata/892/thumb/1634702763","art":"/library/metadata/702/art/1602038143","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/702/thumb/1602038143","originallyAvailableAt":"2002-04-29","leafCount":2,"addedAt":1592507753,"updatedAt":1634702763,"loudnessAnalysisVersion":"2","Genre":[{"tag":"Rap"},{"tag":"Stage & Screen"}],"Director":[{"tag":"Shady Records"}]},{"allowSync":true,"librarySectionID":3,"librarySectionTitle":"Music","librarySectionUUID":"dbf7b04f-3059-4c55-974b-d25cbee68d39","ratingKey":"46806","key":"/library/metadata/46806/children","parentRatingKey":"46805","guid":"plex://album/5d07c5fa403c640290ad1cef","parentGuid":"plex://artist/5d07bc05403c6402904abe24","studio":"Chordant Distribution Group","type":"album","title":"10,000 Reasons","parentKey":"/library/metadata/46805","parentTitle":"Matt Redman","summary":"Matt Redman's deliberate and earnest approach to crafting meaningful worship music has made him a contemporary Christian favorite for over 15 years. His eighth album, 10,000 Reasons, strays little from the winning formula of anthems that are big enough to capture your heart yet simple enough to stick in your head. What endears the U.K. native once again is his utter command of lyrics, instruments, and emotions to create an ongoing worship experience. The album was recorded live for an audience of thousands of worship leaders during LIFT: A Worship Leader Collective in Atlanta, Georgia. By this point in his career, Redman had to dig deep to distinguish this record from the rest of his catalog. For the most part, he makes up for any lack of inventiveness with what he deems the \"fire that burns inside,\" a line that rings out on opening track \"We Are the Free.\" Redman is one of a handful of contemporary Christian artists in whom fans value consistency just as much, if not more, than pure artistry. His fans, along with those of Chris Tomlin, Casting Crowns, Hillsong United, and others, want to know what they can expect from these artists. That is why Redman, who bases all of his songs on scriptural themes, can continue to make hit collections again and again. ~ Jared Johnson","index":1,"rating":8,"year":2011,"thumb":"/library/metadata/46806/thumb/1619532977","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/46805/thumb/1640493899","originallyAvailableAt":"2011-07-12","leafCount":1,"addedAt":1619532949,"updatedAt":1619532977,"loudnessAnalysisVersion":"2","Genre":[{"tag":"Religious"}],"Director":[{"tag":"Chordant Distribution Group"}]},{"allowSync":true,"librarySectionID":3,"librarySectionTitle":"Music","librarySectionUUID":"dbf7b04f-3059-4c55-974b-d25cbee68d39","ratingKey":"45084","key":"/library/metadata/45084/children","parentRatingKey":"45083","guid":"plex://album/5d07c4c0403c640290a279b6","parentGuid":"plex://artist/5d07bbfc403c6402904a6192","studio":"Columbia","type":"album","title":"12 Greatest Hits, Vol. II","parentKey":"/library/metadata/45083","parentTitle":"Neil Diamond","summary":"","index":1,"viewCount":5,"lastViewedAt":1636975510,"year":1985,"thumb":"/library/metadata/45084/thumb/1627100163","art":"/library/metadata/45083/art/1641184618","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/45083/thumb/1641184618","originallyAvailableAt":"1985-01-01","leafCount":11,"addedAt":1619389670,"updatedAt":1627100163,"loudnessAnalysisVersion":"2","Director":[{"tag":"CBS"}]}]}}"""

Together they produce musical and video gems that mash up classical themes with pop songs -- making the group's YouTube channel one of the most visited on the planet.\r\nthe Piano Guys began in St. George, Utah, where Anderson owned a piano shop. Schmidt walked in one day and asked if he could practice on one of the pianos for an upcoming concert. Soon Anderson and Schmidt were recording and making videos together, and with the addition of Nelson, posting them to YouTube. Things continued to grow and expand creatively with van der Beek aboard, and the collective's productions became joyous, thoughtful, and beautiful interactive musical videos that received millions of YouTube hits and brought the Piano Guys worldwide attention.\r\nAfter a self-released debut in 2011 called Hits, Vol. 1, an eponymous album appeared in 2012 via Sony Masterworks. It was followed by Piano Guys 2 in 2013 and a holiday album, A Family Christmas, in 2014. Released that same year, Wonders proved to be the duo's highest-charting album to date, peaking at the number 12 spot on the Billboard 200. Two years later, the quartet returned with their sixth studio album, Uncharted. It reached number 15 and became their fifth straight classical number one and sixth new age number one. Coinciding with a sold-out show at London's Royal Albert Hall, the group issued their first best-of compilation, So Far So Good, in mid-2017. The album included a re-recording of the track \"(It's Gonna Be) Okay,\" which featured guest vocals from Sir Cliff Richard. Their second seasonal album, Christmas Together, followed that October and returned them to the top of the classical and new age charts. The foursome returned the following year with Limitless. Once again they took on contemporary pop hits from the likes of Ed Sheeran, Shawn Mendes, and Korean pop sensations BTS and reworked them into their unique mix of classical and pop. In 2020, the group celebrated ten years in the music game with tenth studio album 10, compiling 15 remastered classics with a plethora of new material, celebrating the group's storied career thus far. ~ Steve Leggett","index":1,"viewCount":150,"skipCount":1,"lastViewedAt":1638695254,"thumb":"/library/metadata/1424/thumb/1642995097","addedAt":1592518631,"updatedAt":1642995097,"Genre":[{"tag":"Easy Listening"},{"tag":"New Age"}],"Country":[{"tag":"United States of America"}]},{"childCount":1,"librarySectionTitle":"Music","ratingKey":"48566","key":"/library/metadata/48566/children","guid":"local://48566","type":"artist","title":"Piano: Peter Schmalfuss","librarySectionID":3,"librarySectionKey":"/library/sections/3","summary":"","index":1,"addedAt":1620508133},{"childCount":1,"librarySectionTitle":"Music","ratingKey":"48557","key":"/library/metadata/48557/children","guid":"local://48557","type":"artist","title":"Clarinet: Elisabeth Canter, Piano:Peter Schmalfuss","librarySectionID":3,"librarySectionKey":"/library/sections/3","summary":"","index":1,"addedAt":1620508091}]},{"title":"Albums","type":"album","hubIdentifier":"album","context":"","size":3,"more":false,"style":"shelf","Metadata":[{"librarySectionTitle":"Music","ratingKey":"39016","key":"/library/metadata/39016/children","parentRatingKey":"3023","guid":"plex://album/5d07c17c403c64029084aec4","parentGuid":"plex://artist/5d07bbfc403c6402904a5bb5","studio":"CBS","type":"album","title":"Piano Man","parentKey":"/library/metadata/3023","librarySectionID":3,"librarySectionKey":"/library/sections/3","parentTitle":"Billy Joel","summary":"Embittered by legal disputes with his label and an endless tour to support a debut that was dead in the water, Billy Joel hunkered down in his adopted hometown of Los Angeles, spending six months as a lounge singer at a club. He didn't abandon his dreams -- he continued to write songs, including \"Piano Man,\" a fictionalized account of his weeks as a lounge singer. Through a combination of touring and constant hustling, he landed a contract with Columbia and recorded his second album in 1973. Clearly inspired by Elton John's Tumbleweed Connection, not only musically but lyrically, as well as James Taylor, Joel expands the vision and sound of Cold Spring Harbor, abandoning introspective numbers (apart from \"You're My Home,\" a love letter to his wife) for character sketches and epics. Even the title track, a breakthrough hit based on his weeks as a saloon singer, focuses on the colorful patrons, not the singer. If his narratives are occasionally awkward or incomplete, he compensates with music that gives the songs a sweeping sense of purpose -- they feel complete, thanks to his indelible melodies and savvy stylistic repurposing. He may have borrowed his basic blueprint from Tumbleweed Connection, particularly with its Western imagery and bluesy gospel flourishes, but he makes it his own, largely due to his melodic flair, which is in greater evidence than on Cold Spring Harbor. Piano Man is where he suggests his potential as a musical craftsman. He may have weaknesses as a lyricist -- such mishaps as the \"instant pleasuredome\" line in \"You're My Home\" illustrate that he doesn't have an ear for words -- but Piano Man makes it clear that his skills as a melodicist can dazzle. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine","index":1,"rating":8.0,"viewCount":45,"lastViewedAt":1643095059,"year":1973,"thumb":"/library/metadata/39016/thumb/1643079902","art":"/library/metadata/3023/art/1643079716","parentThumb":"/library/metadata/3023/thumb/1643079716","originallyAvailableAt":"1973-11-09","addedAt":1615411350,"updatedAt":1643079902,"loudnessAnalysisVersion":"2","Genre":[{"tag":"Pop/Rock"}],"Director":[{"tag":"Columbia"}]},{"librarySectionTitle":"Music","ratingKey":"1425","key":"/library/metadata/1425/children","parentRatingKey":"1424","guid":"plex://album/5d07c7eb403c640290bb9b92","parentGuid":"plex://artist/5d07bdd7403c640290625424","studio":"Portrait","type":"album","title":"A Family Christmas","parentKey":"/library/metadata/1424","librarySectionID":3,"librarySectionKey":"/library/sections/3","parentTitle":"The Piano Guys","summary":"Utah-based classical pop collective/savvy multimedia outfit the Piano Guys' A Family Christmas offers up 12 holiday standards, including \"Angels We Have Heard on High,\" \"Carol of the Bells/God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,\" and \"Silent Night,\" each of which (in typical Piano Guys fashion) will be accompanied by a festive video.

Other members of the sextet were Robert Buck (guitar), Steven Gustafson (bass), Dennis Drew (keyboards), and Jerry Augustyniak (drums). The group gigged extensively and recorded independently before signing with Elektra and making The Wishing Chair in 1985. Co-founder Lombardo left the band in 1986, and they continued as a quintet, releasing their second album, In My Tribe, in 1987. This album broke into the charts, where it stayed 77 weeks, peaking at number 37. Blind Man's Zoo, the 1989 follow-up, hit number 13 and went gold.\r\nAfter 1992's Our Time in Eden had finished its run on the charts, Merchant announced that she was leaving for a solo career. MTV Unplugged was released a few months after her departure. The remaining 10,000 Maniacs decided to continue performing, adding the folk-rock duo John & Mary (original member Lombardo and violinist/vocalist Mary Ramsey). The new lineup released Love Among the Ruins. Merchant released her first solo album, Tigerlily, in the summer of 1995 and a follow-up, Ophelia, in 1998. In 1999, the remaining Maniacs released The Earth Pressed Flat on Bar/None. Sadly, a year later lead guitarist and founding member Robert Buck, who co-wrote some of the band's classics like \"Hey Jack Kerouac,\" \"What's the Matter Here?,\" and \"These Are Days,\" died of liver failure on December 19, 2000. He was 42.\r\nFollowing Buck's death, 10,0000 Maniacs took a year-long hiatus, reconvening in December 2001 to play a benefit concert with Jeff Erickson (now playing guitar). After this concert, Gustafson, Drew, and Augustyniak assembled a new lineup of 10,000 Maniacs featuring guitarist Erickson and vocalist Oskar Saville, who previously sang with Rubygrass. Over the next four years, this version of the Maniacs toured regularly -- their profile was raised somewhat in 2004 when Rhino released the career retrospective Campfire Songs: The Popular, Obscure & Unknown Recordings -- and in 2006, Mary Ramsey began playing the occasional concert with the band. Saville left the band in 2007 and Ramsey returned to her role as frontwoman.\r\n10,000 Maniacs remained a staple on the folk-rock circuit right into the new decade, and in 2011 they released their first new recording in a decade: an EP called Triangles, which appeared on their label, Ruby Wristwatch. That year, the group also played two 30th anniversary concerts in their hometown of Jamestown, New York, then set out to record a new album in 2012. The resulting Music from the Motion Picture -- the first new 10,000 Maniacs album in 14 years -- appeared in February 2013. Not long after its release, Bob Wachter (who had played drums with the group back in 1981 before Augustyniak joined on full-time basis) died at the age of 49. John Lombardo re-joined the band in 2014 as they were recording the album that became Twice Told Tales, a 2015 collection of British folk covers. The following year saw the band celebrating their 35th anniversary with the release of Playing Favorites, a collection of their best-known songs recorded live in Jamestown, New York. ~ William Ruhlmann","index":1,"viewCount":536,"skipCount":18,"lastViewedAt":1640824167,"thumb":"/library/metadata/45209/thumb/1641184622","art":"/library/metadata/45209/art/1641184622","addedAt":1619389679,"updatedAt":1641184622,"Genre":[{"id":8535,"filter":"genre=8535","tag":"Pop/Rock"}],"Country":[{"id":8591,"filter":"country=8591","tag":"United States of America"}],"Style":[{"id":8704,"filter":"style=8704","tag":"Alternative Pop/Rock"},{"id":8547,"filter":"style=8547","tag":"Alternative/Indie Rock"},{"id":14732,"filter":"style=14732","tag":"College Rock"},{"id":15112,"filter":"style=15112","tag":"Jangle Pop"},{"id":8546,"filter":"style=8546","tag":"Pop/Rock"},{"id":14981,"filter":"style=14981","tag":"Adult Alternative Pop/Rock"}],"Similar":[{"id":16777,"filter":"similar=16777","tag":"Natalie Merchant"},{"id":47668,"filter":"similar=47668","tag":"Edie Brickell and New Bohemians"},{"id":16773,"filter":"similar=16773","tag":"Indigo Girls"},{"id":19361,"filter":"similar=19361","tag":"Cowboy Junkies"},{"id":19143,"filter":"similar=19143","tag":"Toad the Wet Sprocket"},{"id":16364,"filter":"similar=16364","tag":"Sarah McLachlan"},{"id":18498,"filter":"similar=18498","tag":"Shawn Colvin"},{"id":26769,"filter":"similar=26769","tag":"Heather Nova"},{"id":16785,"filter":"similar=16785","tag":"Better Than Ezra"},{"id":47669,"filter":"similar=47669","tag":"Beth Orton"},{"id":18827,"filter":"similar=18827","tag":"Sheryl Crow"},{"id":47670,"filter":"similar=47670","tag":"Concrete Blonde"},{"id":16789,"filter":"similar=16789","tag":"Lisa Loeb"},{"id":37836,"filter":"similar=37836","tag":"Juliana Hatfield"},{"id":16743,"filter":"similar=16743","tag":"Gin Blossoms"},{"id":15967,"filter":"similar=15967","tag":"Aimee Mann"},{"id":16520,"filter":"similar=16520","tag":"Sixpence None the Richer"},{"id":18829,"filter":"similar=18829","tag":"Paula Cole"},{"id":26032,"filter":"similar=26032","tag":"The Pretenders"},{"id":18828,"filter":"similar=18828","tag":"Liz Phair"},{"id":41353,"filter":"similar=41353","tag":"Suzanne Vega"},{"id":14738,"filter":"similar=14738","tag":"R.E.M."},{"id":18821,"filter":"similar=18821","tag":"Jewel"},{"id":15560,"filter":"similar=15560","tag":"Hootie & the Blowfish"},{"id":16788,"filter":"similar=16788","tag":"Matthew Sweet"},{"id":14741,"filter":"similar=14741","tag":"Sinéad O'Connor"},{"id":11777,"filter":"similar=11777","tag":"Carly Simon"},{"id":21847,"filter":"similar=21847","tag":"The Go‐Go's"},{"id":44095,"filter":"similar=44095","tag":"Luscious Jackson"},{"id":37837,"filter":"similar=37837","tag":"Throwing Muses"}],"Mood":[{"id":8636,"filter":"mood=8636","tag":"Bittersweet"},{"id":8780,"filter":"mood=8780","tag":"Cerebral"},{"id":14596,"filter":"mood=14596","tag":"Earthy"},{"id":9090,"filter":"mood=9090","tag":"Gentle"},{"id":8538,"filter":"mood=8538","tag":"Literate"},{"id":8622,"filter":"mood=8622","tag":"Melancholy"},{"id":8494,"filter":"mood=8494","tag":"Poignant"},{"id":16875,"filter":"mood=16875","tag":"Sad"},{"id":8542,"filter":"mood=8542","tag":"Wistful"},{"id":8537,"filter":"mood=8537","tag":"Intimate"}],"Location":[{"path":"/mnt/media/Music/10,000 Maniacs"}]}]}}"""
